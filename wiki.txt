== Introduction ==
You can install this addon from: [https://www.urepo.org URepo Repository]
<br />

The RandomScreensaver is an addon that you can select as your screensaver and every time the screensaver starts it will automatically choose one of the screensavers installed on your system and start it.

There is also an option to set time intervals during which a specified screensaver should be used.

This can be very useful if you wish to have a mix of different screensavers used on your installation.
<br />

== Screensaver Support ==
In order for RandomScreensaver to support randomly selecting a screensaver to start, the screensaver must also be configured to run as a script, this means that in addition to the addon.xml file containing:
<source lang="xml">
<extension point="xbmc.ui.screensaver" library="default.py"/>
</source>
It should also contain the following entry:
<source lang="xml">
<extension point="xbmc.python.script" library="default.py" />
</source>
The Kodi default screensavers (Dim and Black) are automatically excluded from any selection.
