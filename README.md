The RandomScreensaver is an addon that you can select as your screensaver and every time the screensaver starts it will either:

* Automatically choose one of the screensavers installed on your system and start it.
* Allow you to schedule different screensavers to be used at different times of the day.

This can be very useful if you wish to have a mix of different screensavers used on your installation.

Things to note:

* The Kodi default screensavers (Dim and Black) are excluded from any random selection
* The screensaver on your system must be able to be started as a script in order to be included in the selection

_Note:_ I have gone through all the screensavers in the official repo and checked to see if they can also be run as a script, if they could not I have supplied Git pull requests to provide this support. (So when they are next published to the repository - if the pull request is merged in - they will work with RandomScreensaver)
